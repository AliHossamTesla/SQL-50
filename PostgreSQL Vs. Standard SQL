- The LIMIT clause is widely used by many Relational Database Management Systems such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, H2, and HSQLDB. However, the LIMIT clause is not a SQL standard.
- Note that the OFFSET clause must come before the FETCH clause in SQL:2008. However, OFFSET and FETCH clauses can appear in any order in PostgreSQL.
